	git		9418
	file (local)	n/a

2. git branch
//display local branches of current repo
git branch -r
//display remote branches of repo

3. git branch branchname
//create a new branch with branchname, pointing to the current HEAD commit
   git checkout branchname
//switch to branch with branchname, change the HEAD pointer to this branch

Note: tags are like branches, but they do not move

7. git remote add origin https... (https protocol) or git@... (ssh protocol)
   git push -u origin master
//before add the origin, you need to creat a new repo on github and follow the instruction there to get the repo's address
//if this is the first time you add the local repo (from your computer), you will need to add your computer's public ssh 
key to github first

8. git fetch + git merge == git pull
//fetch the repo from origin/master, then merge with local repo master

9. git clone git@.../https...
//clone a remote repo to make a local repo
